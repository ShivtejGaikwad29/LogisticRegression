# LogisticRegression
Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using a logistic regression model. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is known as the Heart Disease Dataset.
Dataset
The dataset includes over 1191 records and 12 attributes covering age , cholestrol , resting_bp and medical risk factors.
Results
The logistic regression model provides a probabilistic estimate of the risk of heart disease, helping in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare measures.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression in predicting heart disease risk, highlighting the importance of early detection and intervention in reducing cardiovascular complications.
